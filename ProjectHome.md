PEEL, with its ever-redundant project name, is a python-based library for manipulating and wrangling PE files.

The idea behind PEEL is to make everything addressable. All objects have an "address," so to speak. This makes maneuvering through the image less of a hassle as a result. In fact, it makes coding for PE files rather fun! (At least in my opinion, anyway. :)

Clone it with Git and be on your way!
